To run this project first of all run requirements.py with internet turned on to ensure that all the required modules are installed in your desktop.
Then run login.py. If you are running this programme for the first time you might be prompted to a GUI window asking you to enter correct password.
The creation of database might take some time depending on the specifications of your computer, kindly be patient in this stage.
If all goes well you will be taken to the login screen of our project.

Login Screen has two parts: One for customers and one for employees. Select the appropriate one.
In order to use employee option you need to enter credentials. For the demonstrations of this project you can enter the following credentials:-
Employee ID = 4

Password = projectroot

In customer section you will be able to create your account and then use it to login as customer later.
